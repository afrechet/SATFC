# Feasibility Checker

This is the README for SATFC. For information on the reverse auction simulator, see [this README](simulator/README.md).

## Introduction

**SATFC** (_SAT-based Feasibility Checker_) solves radio-spectrum repacking feasibility problems arising in the reverse auction of the FCC's upcoming broadcast incentive auction. It combines a formulation of feasibility checking based on propositional satisfiability with a heuristic pre-solver and a SAT solver tuned for the types of instances observed in auction simulations.
authors & collaborators SATFC is the product of the ideas and hard work of Auctionomics, notably Alexandre FreÃÅchette, Neil Newman, Paul Cernek, Emily Chenn, Guillaume Saulnier-Comte, Nick Arnosti, and Kevin Leyton-Brown.

## Installation

Stand-alone, ready-to-go releases of SATFC and SATFCServer can be found on the [SATFC GitHub](https://github.com/FCC/SATFC/releases) page.

## Usage

Please consult the manual [SATFC-manual](satfc/src/dist/SATFC-manual.pdf). The manual is also packaged with any stand-alone SATFC release.

## Release Notes

Rough information about the evolution of **SATFC** through major releases.

### SATFC 2.3 [29/3/2016]

* Switch the default portfolio to a newly configured eight core portfolio 

### SATFC 2.2 [15/2/2016]

* Improve the memory usage of SATFCServer
* Various bugfixes

### SATFC 2.0 [15/10/2015]

* Introduce SATenstein, a local search based solver

### SATFC 1.8 [19/08/2015]

* ADJ+2 and ADJ-2 constraints 
* Enforce arc consistency as a form of preprocessing
* Expanding neighbourhood UNSAT presolver
* Identify conditionally underconstrained stations
* Improve underconstrained station finding heuristic 
* Upgrade to clasp 3.1.3
* Multi-permutation server cache to guard against cache query slowdowns

### SATFC 1.7.1 [30/06/2015]

* New required command line parameter for the server, _constraint.folder_, that tells the server where all of the data folders are so that it can properly size cache entries
* Upgrade to clasp 3.1.2

### SATFC 1.7 [8/06/2015]

* New feature, _parallel portfolios_, allow SATFC to execute multiple solvers in parallel, returning a result as soon as any solver succeeds. Previous versions of SATFC applied each solver sequentially.
* Enhanced the presolver technique to look beyond a station's immediate neighbours

### SATFC 1.6 [19/05/2015]

* Upgrade from **clasp** version from 2 to 3, along with new better performing configurations.
* The **SATFCserver** now has a clever clean up procedures to prune away unnecessary entries if the cache becomes too big.
* The cache is now updated on the fly. This means instances solved are immediately accessible to future cache queries (improving performance), and the cache server does not need to be restarted to have access to new data (improving usability). 

### SATFC 1.5 [26/03/2015]

* New feature, _containment cache_, that uses previously solved problems to solve new, related problems. Our experiments with this feature show that it provides significant performance increase, not only by taking care of problems that are seen often (e.g. from very similar auction runs), but also improving solving time of new, unseen problems. This cache is implemented as a standalone server, the **SATFCserver**, to allow multiple **SATFC** solvers to use the same cache and reduce memory overhead. This server in turn uses **redis** as its backbone cache data structure.

### SATFC 1.3 [30/10/2014]

* First official release of **SATFC** by the FCC.
